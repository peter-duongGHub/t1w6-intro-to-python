# Intro to Python

## Programming Language

- A language that writes programs for computers.

## Program

- Set of instructions that computers know how to execute 
- Converts programming language commands /instructions in machine language.

## Data types
<!-- Primitive Data Types -->
- Different data
- Depends on the program language
- Integers (1, 2, 3, 0, -5, 12312)
- Floats (3.5, -4.12, .7.124124)
- Strings ("Hello", '1234', "", ...)
- Boolean (True/False, 1/0)
<!-- Non primitive Data Types -->

## Variables

- Container for our piece of data 
- Whenever we want that data, we can use the variables
- Change the variable value as we want

## REPL
<!-- Python Interpreter -->
- Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop
<!-- Exit python by exit() or quit() -->
